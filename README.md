# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection_SMOTE
Built a credit card fraud detection model. Best performance came from a multilayer perceptron with a 99% recall score.

The dataset was heavily imbalanced so I applied a SMOTE oversampling technique to improve model performance

Main packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, imblearn, matplotlib
